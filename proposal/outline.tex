\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}

The rest of this document is structured as follows. In Chapter 2, I discuss related work.
Once the related is covered, I present the foundations of the Snippet Retargeting Approach in Chapter 3, 4, and 5. Chapter 3 describes the policy behind \uppercase{SnipR}. In Chapter 4, I describe the learning algorithm for building code mappings from code examples. This chapter also describes two procedures needed to set up \uppercase{SnipR}. In Chapter 5, I present Twist, a language for interacting with search results, and combining
and executing code retargeting operations. In Chapter 6, the proposed solutions, including the evaluation, and the work timeline are presented. Then, in Chapter 7, I discuss many possible practical applications of this research. Finally, Chapter 8 concludes the proposal.
