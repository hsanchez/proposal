\lettrine[lraise=0.1, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{T}{HIS DOCUMENT HAS} introduced \uppercase{SnipR}, an approach that complements code search with code retargeting capabilities. Unlike prior work, the \uppercase{SnipR} enables developers to engage in a virtuous loop where they find and select only the promising example code that can be retargeted. This will minimize the number of iterations in the search process the developer has to go through, since the evaluation step is only dealing with best choices---choices that would be easier to consume later in the IDE. It is envisioned that \uppercase{SnipR} will not be seen as a competitor to any code search systems, but more like a platform. A platform for searching for suitable code.
