## Contributions

Contributions of all kinds, including corrections, additions, and improvements
are always welcome!

Here are a few notes before you jump in.

### Style

- Stay close to the existing style of the document when possible.
- Remember to focus on **brevity**, **specificity**, and **utility.**
- Avoid long explanations and instead prefer links to resources.
- Make sure file names end in the suffix ".md" or ".tex" (for LaTeX files).
- Remember that file names should be no more than 32 characters.
- Name your files with names that will help you remember what is in them.
- Make sure your file names and folder names contain only letters, digits,
	and underscoresâ€”no spaces, punctuation, or funny characters.

### Inline comments (On Markdown)

To add inline comments (which are pieces of text being included in the
output HTML rendered by GitHub, even if they are not displayed), use this
format:


**Format**: visible text &#60;inline comment&#62;

Example:

Using @hsanchez's guidelines <!-- (@otheruser they are harsh) --> &#60;some text got included here, but not rendered...&#62;


### Using issues and pull requests (PRs)

- Please **create and comment on issues freely** to discuss. A lot of the difficulty in accepting PRs
is around style and format, and whether changes should be made at all, so rationale or explanations for
the change are useful.
- Please **review open issues and pull requests** before submitting a new one, to help reduce duplication.
- To the extent possible, **break up changes into multiple PRs** so they can be approved separately. Large
contributions are also welcome, but are harder and slower to approve, as they tend to require discussion or rewriting.
