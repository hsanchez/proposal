\section{Comparison to State-of-the-Art}
\label{sec:related}
Social scientists have used social network models (e.g., game theoretic,
statistical models) to infer network structure and relationships. These models
are currently used in education research to assess collaboration and team
dynamics. We will build on these current models to assess team dynamics, and
extend beyond them by bringing in theories of hierarchical network structure and
centrality.
