% \unsure{\Daniel I vote on removing this entire section ... unless we can think
% of something badass.}{In order to quantify and evaluate interaction sequences,
% we will use probabilistic modeling to measure if the behavioral patterns we
% uncovered improve model quality; specifically, a subsequence interleaving
% probabilistic model. To evaluate the quality of clustering adversarial and
% defensive interactions, we will use purity, an external evaluation criterion of
% cluster quality.}
