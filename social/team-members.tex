\section{Team members}
\label{sec:team}
Our team is uniquely suited to tackle this problem -- we are a talented
multidisciplinary team of researchers from \SRI and the \UCSC who will integrate
social and cognitive models of human behavior and performance with both leading
software repository mining and program analysis techniques to develop social
generative models of software development. We fully expect that this project
will open the door to a tangential field that integrates social science and
computer science in a novel way.
