hardly reasonable to assume that the number of possible code stages is static. Yet, \textit{MethodStaging}\cite{foo} must maintain a sequence of code stages that is (approximately) 
consistent with the requirements, e.g., a permutation of code stages that is almost sorted. Thus, 
it is important to make \textit{MethodStaging} robust to changes in its input source code, 
i.e., it produces an output comprehensible code stages, strengths program comprehension,  
and eliminates ``obviously'' disqualified code stages.
