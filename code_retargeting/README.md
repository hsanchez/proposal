To get a pdf version of my advancement proposal you must have the Rake gem installed. It has been tested on rake (0.9.2) but it probably works on earlier version as well.

To Install:
In the dissertation root directory run:
$ sudo gem install rake

(you might need to install dependencies if Rake doesn't do it for you)

To run:
$ rake pdf


To clean:
$ rake clean
