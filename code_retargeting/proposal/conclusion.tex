\lettrine[lraise=0.1, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{T}{HIS DOCUMENT HAS} introduced \uppercase{SnipR}, an approach that complements code search with code retargeting capabilities. Unlike prior work, the \uppercase{SnipR} enables developers to engage in a virtuous loop where they find and select only the code examples they can justify as suitable. This minimizes the number of iterations in the search process the developer has to go through. It is envisioned that \uppercase{SnipR} will not be seen as a competitor to any code search systems, but more like a platform. A platform for searching for suitable code.
