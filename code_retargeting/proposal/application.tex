\chapter{Practical Applications}{}

\lettrine[lraise=0.1, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{T} {HERE ARE MANY} possible practical applications of a \uppercase{SnipR}--aware code search engine. First, the \uppercase{SnipR} approach can be applied throughout many of the phases of the software development process---in or out of the IDEs---and much more:

\begin{itemize}
\item During concept development, to rapidly explore all kinds application 
    scenarios.
\item During prototyping where there is not enough time to invest in 
    code robustness and maintainability~\cite{Brandt:2008wi, Ncube:2008fm, Brandt:2009jb}. 
\item During application refinement using agile development methods. 
\item During program comprehension where the goal is to learn how to program or 
    to teach someone's children how to program.  
\item During code competitions where the emphasis is on speed and time to win 
    the competition\footnote{http://code.google.com/codejam}.
\item During training for a programming interview where the chief goal is succeeding on the 
    interview and possible getting hired.
\end{itemize}

In a world where the vast majority of programming knowledge is archived and curated by millions of ``experts,'' it is not far-fetched to believe that a new category of ``Just in time programmers''\footnote{those ones with the ability to combine snippets to build solutions that will just meet their needs} will arise. Consequently, it is envisioned that the \uppercase{SnipR} approach will be one of the tools that these programmers will use.
