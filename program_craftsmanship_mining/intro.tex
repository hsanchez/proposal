\label{sec:overview}

\startWith{p}{rogram design} plays an important role in software development. 
However, it is both a complex and creative process, which can only be performed 
by developers after much practice (over many years). In today’s modern society, 
while the number of opportunistic programmers (a.k.a., citizen programmers) is 
growing at an astounding rate, the percentage of the population with a well-rounded 
program design experience remains in the single digits. This means that we are 
witnessing a growing gap between need and capacity. We can meet some of the need 
by using configurable apps with canned behavior, but these restrict creativity and 
problem solving to those anticipated by the creators of these apps. Therefore, it 
is critical that we find ``programmatic'' ways in which both traditionally and 
non-traditionally educated programmers can express themselves by borrowing the 
same skills and creativity as the formally trained pros.

In a new research direction, we term Program Craftsmanship Mining, we aim at 
making some of these abilities, which allow star programmers to succeed, available 
to citizen programmers by applying machine learning to program craftsmanship. Using 
ready available Web data (e.g., GitHub repositories), we will exploit machine 
learning techniques, such as structured prediction, nonparametric bayesian 
analysis, and program induction to enable new interaction mechanisms for program 
craftsmanship.

\todo{The below paragraph is too general and scope is too big. Try to refocus it
and then include the fact that we are only doing flavor bounding.}
Program Craftsmanship Mining enables computers to join developers on multiple 
development activities as equal partners—knowledgeable, creative, and proactively 
responsible. It does it by learning and then operationalizing a type of human-like 
wisdom geared towards program design construction. Program craftsmanship mining will 
manifest this human-like wisdom throughout development, in creativity and 
proactivity, and within the system's own structure and behavior. 


\section*{Broader Impact} % (fold)
\label{sec:impact}

Computer systems affect most parts of our lives. Countless examples of the grave 
consequences caused by poorly crafted software systems include severe financial damages 
or even the loss of lives. With the looming advent of Citizen Programming, the amount 
of code to be produced by opportunistic programmers grows at a staggering pace, 
demanding for more automated tools to ensure software quality. This project contributes 
an automated light-weight program construction technique that will help developers write 
code according to specific style of programming (we term programming flavors). Further, 
the project will create a suite of benchmarks to serve as baseline for other automated 
program construction tools.


\section*{Intellectual Merit} % (fold)
\label{sec:merit}

This project proposes a novel approach for program construction. Encouraged by many 
recent advances in code transplantation, data-driven Web design, and software evolution 
simulation, we present program program craftsmanship mining.  The key innovations 
behind this approach include:
