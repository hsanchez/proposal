\lettrine[lraise=0.1, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{D}{ESIGN} plays an important 
role in software development. Program design, however, is both a complex and 
a creative process which can only be performed by software developers after 
much training. Software developers must identify structural regularities in 
code, operationalize coding conventions, and apply the proper idioms. These 
regularities explicitly molds the software system with design and coding
principles that intend to improve its quality in terms of reusability, extensibility
and comprehensibility.    

Advances in pattern-directed development, model-driven engineering, 
and search-driven development have paved the way for intelligent software engineering 
environments to actively contribute to this design process and thus liberate 
developers from some of its complexities. While each new generation of tools helps 
tackle the complexity of program design, the solutions reach their limits, and 
resolving the great difficulties of designing reliable systems remains a major, 
and critical, moving target.

To address this problem, we propose program craftsmanship mining: a data-driven 
approach for program craftsmanship. Program craftsmanship mining enables computers 
to join developers on multiple development activities as equal partners—knowledgeable, 
creative, and proactively responsible. This project will investigate how to operationalize 
a type of human-like wisdom that is geared towards program construction. Program craftsmanship 
mining will manifest this human-like wisdom throughout development, in creativity and 
proactivity, and within the system’s own structure and behavior.
