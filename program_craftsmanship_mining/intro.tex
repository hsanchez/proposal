\lettrine[lraise=0.1, nindent=0em, slope=-.5em]{P}{ROGRAM DESIGN}  plays an 
important role in software development. However, it is both a complex and 
creative process, which can only be performed by developers after much 
practice (over many years). In today’s modern society, while the number of 
people with programming ability is growing at an astounding rate, the 
percentage of the population with a well-rounded program design experience 
remains in the single digits. This means that we are witnessing a growing gap 
between need and capacity. Some of the need is met by fiddling with configurable 
apps with canned behavior, but these restrict creativity and problem solving. The 
capacity is met by expecting that nearly all citizen have a capacity to program 
design. Therefore, it is critical that find ``programmatic'' way in which 
non-traditionally educated programmers can borrow the same skills as the formally 
trained pros.   


In a new research direction, we term Program Craftsmanship Mining, we aim at 
making some of these abilities, which allow star programmers to succeed, available 
to citizen programmers by applying machine learning to program craftsmanship. We 
will exploit techniques, such as structured prediction, nonparametric bayesian 
analysis, and program induction to facilitate useful interactions for program 
craftsmen. Additionally, it will exploit ready available Web data (e.g., GitHub 
repositories) to foster design inspiration when innovation is required.

Program Craftsmanship Mining enables computers to join developers on multiple 
development activities as equal partners—knowledgeable, creative, and proactively 
responsible. It does it by learning and then operationalizing a type of human-like 
wisdom geared towards program design construction.  Program craftsmanship mining will 
manifest this human-like wisdom throughout development, in creativity and 
proactivity, and within the system’s own structure and behavior.
