\startWith{w}{riting code} is not a manufacturing process, it's not 
always craftsmanship, it's design. Design is where developers add 
value faster than they add cost. However, design is both a complex 
and creative process, which can only be performed by developers after 
much practice (over many years). In todayâ€™s modern society, while the 
number of people with programming ability is growing at an astounding 
rate, the percentage of the population with a well-rounded program 
design experience remains in the single digits. This means that we are 
witnessing a growing gap between need and capacity. One can meet some of 
the need by using configurable programs with canned behavior, but these 
restrict creativity and problem solving to those anticipated by the 
creators of those programs. Therefore, it is critical that we find 
programmatic ways in which both traditionally and non-traditionally 
educated programmers can express themselves by borrowing the same skills 
and creativity of the formally trained pros.

In a new research direction, we term Program Design Mining, we propose  
making some of the abilities\footnote{e.g., molding programs via idioms, coding principles, and design patterns}, which allow star developers to succeed, 
available to citizen programmers by applying machine learning to program 
design. \todo{List these abilities: e.g., idioms, design patterns, 
coding principles} Using ready available Web data (e.g., GitHub 
repositories), we will exploit machine learning techniques, such as 
structured prediction, nonparametric bayesian analysis, and program 
induction to enable new interaction mechanisms for program design.

All of these machine learning techniques leverage structure regularities 
that are intrinsic to program designs. Well-written (object-oriented) programs, 
for example, exhibit many structural regularities\footnote{These regularities explicitly molds programs with design and coding principles that intend to improve their quality} and their identification and manipulation improves with experience. Machine 
learning can eliminate the need for designing experience. On the Web data, 
every Java class is associated with an abstract syntax tree. This information 
can be used along with the change history of this class to reason about and 
manipulate such structural regularities, closer to way experienced developers 
will use. 

With Program Design Mining, we will entirely decouple the ability of 
designing quality programs from years of experience. Design wisdom will 
not come with time. It will come with new design interactions learned 
from data. Developers will be able to evolve their programs with 
sound design and coding principles. At every opportunity, they will try 
a different design alternative and experience the results. Program design 
mining will exploit ready available Web data to foster design inspiration 
when innovation is required.

In what follows, we will cover the intellectual merit of data-driven 
approaches for program design, as well as the broader impact of Program 
Design Mining.

\section*{Intellectual Merit} % (fold)
\label{sec:merit}

This project proposes a novel approach for program design and 
evolution. Encouraged by many recent advances in code transplantation, 
data-driven Web design, and software evolution simulation, we 
present program design mining. The key innovations behind this 
approach include:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Data-driven program design (we call design bouncing). Establish 
	new design workflows from existing design knowledge. These workflows 
	allow citizen programmers to automatically transfer the structural 
	regularities from a well-written program into the style and structure 
	of another.  
	\item Operationalize learned structures, which are intrinsic to program 
	designs to build more powerful design workflows. On our collected Web 
	data, every Java class is associated with an abstract syntax tree, 
	which can be used with its change history to reason about and 
	manipulate programs with \textit{similar} structures.
	\item Mixed-initiative program design evolution.     
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Broader Impact} % (fold)
\label{sec:impact}

Computer systems affect most parts of our lives. Countless examples of 
the grave consequences caused by poorly crafted software systems include 
severe financial damages or even the loss of lives. With the looming 
advent of Citizen Programming, the amount of code to be produced by 
opportunistic programmers grows at a staggering pace, demanding for more 
automated tools to ensure software quality. This project contributes a 
data-driven program construction technique that will help people with 
programming ability to write code closer to what an experienced programmer 
would write. Further, the project will create a suite of benchmarks to 
serve as baseline for other automated program construction tools.

SRI International and University of California Santa Cruz make considerable 
contributions to education, research, and technology transfer to industry 
through its freely distributed tools and academic visitor programs such 
as include summer internships for graduate students that encourage applications 
from minority students.
