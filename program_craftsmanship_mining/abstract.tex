This paper presents Program Design Mining. It 
discusses the challenges and opportunities of applying machine 
learning to program design. It describes how structured prediction, 
nonparametric bayesian analysis, and program induction can 
facilitate useful interactions for program designers. These 
techniques exploit ready available Web data to foster design 
inspiration when innovation is required.
