This paper summarizes challenges and opportunities of 
applying machine learning to program design. It describes 
how structured prediction, nonparametric bayesian analysis, 
and program induction can facilitate useful interactions 
for program designers. These techniques exploit ready 
available Web data to foster design inspiration when 
innovation is required.
