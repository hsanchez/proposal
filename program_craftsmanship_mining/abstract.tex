This paper presents Program Design Mining, a data-driven approach 
for program design. It combines structured prediction, 
nonparametric bayesian analysis, and program induction to 
facilitate useful interactions for program designers. These 
techniques exploit ready available Web data to foster design 
inspiration when innovation is required.
