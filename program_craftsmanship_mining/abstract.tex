This paper presents Program Design Mining, a data-driven approach 
for program design. This approach applies machine learning techniques,
such as structured prediction, nonparametric bayesian analysis, and 
program induction to facilitate new design interactions for program 
designers. Using ready available Web data, these techniques leverage 
the inherent structure of program designs to reason about and 
to manipulate the structural regularities of programs.
