\startWith{d}{evelopers} frequently rely on templates (e.g., 
recipes in Eclipse) when design programs in modern Integrated 
Development Environments (IDEs). While these templates provide 
a simple mechanism for implementing canned behavior, there are a 
few issues that hinder their applicability: (1) Templates creation 
is tedious, which restricts productivity, and (2) Templates rigidity 
limits customization and creativity.

Program Design Mining will implement a data-driven approach for 
program design. This approach consists of a platform, and a set of 
algorithms, such as: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A new structured prediction algorithm for rapidly transferring 
	the structural regularities of well-written (object-oriented) programs, 
	selected by a programmer, into the style and structure of another one.
	\item A new program induction algorithm for learning and operationalizing 
	(composition or remix) learned templates to foster program design 
	inspiration when innovation is required.
	\item Mixed Initiative ...
\end{enumerate}

State of the art data-driven tools for program synthesis, program 
improvement, and code transplantation, such as X, Y, and Z, focus 
on the code itself and struggle with transferring code from one system 
to another, because of the nontrivial modifications needed to relocate 
unrelated foreign code fragments into a new system.
