\startWith{d}{evelopers} frequently rely on templates (e.g., 
recipes in Eclipse) when design programs in modern Integrated 
Development Environments (IDEs). While these templates provide 
a simple mechanism for implementing canned behavior, there are a 
few issues that hinder their benefit: (1) Templates creation 
restricts productivity, (2) their rigidity limits customization, 
and (2) restrict creativity to those anticipated by their creators.

Program Design Mining will propose a new structured prediction 
algorithm that allow us to use existing well-written programs 
as design templates.    

State of the art data-driven tools for program synthesis, program 
improvement, and code transplantation, such as X, Y, and Z, focus 
on the code itself and struggle with transferring code from one system 
to another, because of the nontrivial modifications needed to relocate 
unrelated foreign code fragments into a new system.
