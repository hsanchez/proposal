\startWith{o}{perationalizing} structural regularities is hard. Operationalizing programming flavor is hard. It requires the modeling of what it means for a program to have human-like program construction wisdom, the transferring of such a wisdom from external sources, and then operationalizing it locally to produce quality software. State of the art data-driven tools for program synthesis, program improvement, and code transplantation, such as X, Y, and Z, focus on the code itself and struggle with transferring code from one system to another, because of the nontrivial modifications needed to relocate unrelated foreign code fragments into a new system.
