\subsection{Plan of Work} % {Implementation and Evaluation}
\label{sec-impl}
The proposed research will be implemented as part of the \jayhorn tool,
which is freely available and open-source. Findings will be documented
as scientific publications where possible or as part of the \jayhorn
developer blog. 

A large part of the anticipated contribution will be the set of
benchmarks that are generated during the execution of this project to 
showcase which class of programs can be verified with specific extensions
to \jayhorn. The benchmarks will be shared along with an infrastructure
to run \jayhorn and comparable tools.

The project duration is three years, and tasks will be carried out in parallel.
While the three proposed tasks have mutual beneficial effects, each task can
be carried out without relying on the success of the other tasks. 
The effect of each proposed task will be evaluated in isolation and in 
combination with the other tasks. 

We are currently in discussion with the developers of several other 
verification tools (
CBMC~\cite{DBLP:conf/tacas/KroeningT14}, CPAChecker~\cite{Beyer:2011:CTC:2032305.2032321}, Ultimate~\cite{heizmann2015ultimate}, and Smack~\cite{cav2014-re}) who
are also actively working on analysis tools for Java. We expect
that the results of this project can also be disseminated as part of a verification
competition as it is customary for C verification tools.
