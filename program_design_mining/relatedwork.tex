\subsection{Related Work: Program Improvement Techniques}
\label{sec-existing}

The literature on program improvement is rising. Code transplantation, for
example, has demonstrated that is possible to evolve new versions of a software
using genetic programming in isolation. In particular, recent results on genetic
improvement demonstrated that it is possible to evolve new versions of the
system to optimize non-functional properties, while retaining the functional
properties
